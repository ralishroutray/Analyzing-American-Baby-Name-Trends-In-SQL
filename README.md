# Project Summary

This project involves analyzing a dataset of baby names to identify trends and patterns, specifically focusing on the most popular male first names over the years. The analysis is carried out step by step, using SQL for data querying and manipulation, followed by Python for further data processing and analysis. Below is a detailed summary of each step involved in the project.

## Step 1: Data Preparation

- The dataset, stored in a DataFrame named `baby_names`, contains columns for `year`, `first_name`, `sex`, and `num` (the number of occurrences of the name).
- Initial data exploration is performed to understand the dataset's structure, content, and any cleaning that may be required.

## Step 2: Identifying Top Male Names Per Year

- A SQL query is used to find the most popular male first name for each year. This involves:
  - Filtering the dataset for male names (`sex = 'M'`).
  - Grouping the data by `year` and using the `MAX(num)` function to find the highest occurrence of any name in that year.
  - Joining this result with the original dataset to get the corresponding first names.

## Step 3: Aggregating Top Names Across Years

- The SQL query from the previous step is encapsulated within a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `top_male_names`.
- Another SQL query is then executed to select the first name and count the number of years each name appeared as the year's top name. This is achieved by:
  - Grouping the results by `first_name`.
  - Ordering the results by the count in descending order to identify the names that have been most frequently the top name.

## Step 4: Data Analysis in Python

- The SQL query results are stored in a DataFrame, presumably `df7`, which contains columns for `first_name` and `count_top_name`.
- Further analysis can be conducted in Python using this DataFrame, such as:
  - Visualizing the distribution of top names over the years.
  - Comparing the popularity of top names to identify trends.

## Step 5: Conclusion

- The final step involves summarizing the findings from the analysis. This might include:
  - Identifying the most popular male first name of all time and its characteristics.
  - Discussing any notable trends observed in the popularity of male first names over the years.
  - Providing insights into how naming conventions or preferences might have evolved.

This project demonstrates the power of combining SQL and Python for data analysis, allowing for efficient data manipulation and detailed trend analysis.
